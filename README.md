# Intermittent Asset Resolution Error in Expo CLI

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using the Expo CLI to build a React Native application. The issue involves intermittent asset resolution errors during both development and build processes, making it challenging to pinpoint and fix.

## Bug Description

The error message is vague, typically related to asset resolution but without a clear indication of the affected file or the underlying cause.  The error appears sporadically, making it difficult to reproduce reliably. Standard troubleshooting steps, such as clearing the cache, reinstalling packages, and verifying file paths, have not yielded a solution.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the error occurring intermittently during development (exact timing is not predictable).
5. Attempt `expo build:ios` to trigger the error in a build context.

## Solution

The solution involves [description of solution, may include links, etc.].
