While developing an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error during the build process.  The error message was vague, mentioning a problem with asset resolution, but didn't pinpoint the exact file or cause.  My project structure was seemingly correct, and I had followed Expo's documentation carefully.  The error would appear intermittently, making debugging difficult.  I tried cleaning the cache, reinstalling dependencies, and checking for typos in the file paths, but none of these solved the problem. The error would randomly manifest during `expo start` and `expo build:ios` with no clear pattern.
